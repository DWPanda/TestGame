# TestGame
need help getting it to work, gamemanager.js:51 = error.  can't seem to get avatar-enemy img's to show up or after selecting a class "find enemy" causes error to pop up (gamemanager.js:51) and health isn't shown. essentially you can't fight if enemy isn't found.

Folders are set up as follows (since i'm still learning how to navigate/use github)

Folder main: "TestGame"
>>Files inside TestGame: index.html, style.css

Folders inside "TestGame":
>img
>>inside "img" folder
---> avatar-enemies, avatar-player, js, arena-bg.png

>js
>>inside "js"
---> enemy.js , player.js , gamemanager.js

// I do not know how to upload project the same way i have it configured on my computer, if you know how  please tell me.
// Main errors i'm getting atm are "gamemanager.js:51" when clicking on "Find Enemy"
// Secondary error = health does not go down when hit (i can't see enemy avatar pic/stats)
// Last one I can think of = once player hits he keeps hitting, once enemy hits he keeps hitting, there is no randomization...
